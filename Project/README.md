# Project 3: LCD Game F1 CAR
## Introduction

This game represents a car that has to go in between two obstacles. Once it touches the objective it will add one to the current score and it will display it. If the car does not touch the objective nothing will be added. Button 3 and 4 will move left and right and will make a sound.

At first the shape with the objective and the obstacles will appear from the top and will go down until it reaches the bottom of the screen. To move left you push button 3 and to move right you move button 4.

I received advise from Jose Yanez to implement what I already did on lab 2 in regards to the sound.

How to run the program:

make all ----- in order to compile the c files and create the .o files


make load ----- to run it and load it to the MSP430

make clean ------ to delete .o files
